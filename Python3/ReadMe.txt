This is the Python 3.6 version of TOECalc. This is the updated and maintained version of TOECalc.

There are two main folders: 
Cubic_symmetry - Contains scripts for calculating Elastic constants for cubic crystals only. Additionally contains further processing of these results. Mostly based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2737
Arbitrary_symmetry - Contains scripts for calculating elastic constants for crystals of arbitrary symmetry. Does not contain any further processing as such calculations are typically structure dependent.
