This is the Python 2.7 version of TOECalc. It will no longer be improved (as of January 2019) and no new features will be added as a new version for Python 3 is in development. All new features will be only added to the Python 3 version.

There are two main folders: 
Cubic_symmetry - Contains scripts for calculating Elastic constants for cubic crystals only. Additionally contains further processing of these results. Mostly based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2737
Arbitrary_symmetry - Contains scripts for calculating elastic constants for crystals of arbitrary symmetry. Does not contain any further processing as such calculations are typically structure dependent.
